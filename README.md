# Vectrex Emulator for Unity

This is in no way a complete project but it was a fun proof of concept.
Feel free to use the code, but it would be nice to mention it's source.

It was more a trial from my side to convert an existing C++ project to C# and
to see how it performs when it works inside oy Unity.

Find here the YouTube video for it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7vWfsOyqOY
